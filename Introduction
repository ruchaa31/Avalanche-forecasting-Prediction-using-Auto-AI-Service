# Avalanche-forecasting-Prediction-using-Auto-AI-Service

This project prevents the people from the avalanche by priory informing them there is a chance to the occurrence of avalanche or not. The model gets the data from the IOT based sensors. After that we want to process those data using a suitable algorithm, then our model display whether the avalanche occur or not and how strength it was. To analyse the data coming from different sensors we are applying various machine learning algorithms. If there is a chance of avalanche then the notification will be sent to people so that they can take decisions accordingly and the model is been built in Auto AI.
